# Context

We want a two-key flow: the agent plans and drafts prompts; the human explicitly approves and runs codex exec; the agent verifies and opens a PR pending acceptance.

# Task

- Add a "Human-Run Mode (Two-Key)" subsection to AGENTS.md (Protocol section) describing:
  - Approval tokens: approve-plan, approve-run, accept (with <prompt-id>)
  - Flow: plan-only → human-run → verify+PR
  - The exact run command: `cat <prompt> | codex exec -m gpt-5-codex -C . --full-auto`
  - Branch naming convention including the prompt id
  - PR template checklist reference
- Leave session Decision pending; do not self-accept.

# Acceptance

- Subsection present and clear; smoke still passes.
- Session log committed with prompt snapshot and SHA.
```

## Verification
- smoke: pass
  - 88:### Human-Run Mode (Two-Key)

## Decision
- accept: <yes|no>

## Next Steps
- Begin using Human-Run mode approvals for upcoming prompts
