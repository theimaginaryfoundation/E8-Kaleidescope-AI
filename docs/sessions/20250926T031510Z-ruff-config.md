## Changes Summary
- key files:
  - pyproject.toml: added [tool.ruff] and [tool.ruff.lint]
  - .gitignore: added .ruff_cache
  - docs/dev.md: added Ruff usage notes
- rationale:
  - Introduce lint configuration without affecting runtime; prepare for gradual enforcement.

title: Add Ruff config + minimal lint gate
owner: @ty
created_utc: 2025-09-26T00:00:00Z
acceptance:
  - [tool.ruff] config added to pyproject with a sane default rule set
  - `uv run ruff check --exit-zero .` runs in CI without breaking
  - Document lint usage in README or docs
  - Smoke test passes
risk: low
notes: |
  Start with light enforcement (format-only or warnings) to avoid large diffs.

# Context

Linting will help keep the new modules clean. We'll start permissive and tighten later.

# Task

- Add `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.ruff.lint]` sections to `pyproject.toml` with a baseline (e.g., select `E,F,W,I`).
- Optionally add `exclude = ["e8_mind_server_M24.py"]` for now to avoid churn.
- Add a CI step to run `ruff check --exit-zero .`.
- Add a short note to `docs/` about running Ruff with `uv`.

# Acceptance

- Running `uv run ruff check --exit-zero .` completes successfully.
- CI file present with lint job (does not fail PRs yet).
- Smoke test still passes.

# Out of scope

- Mass auto-fixes; hold until modules exist.
```

## Verification
- smoke: pass
- greps:
  - 47:[tool.ruff]
  - 56:[tool.ruff.lint]

## Decision
- accept: yes

## Notes
- CI step deferred by owner request (no CI/CODEOWNERS yet).
