# --- Core Semantics & Persona ---
# This section defines the base personality and conceptual space for the AI.
# The 'persona_prefix' function now dynamically adjusts the persona based on the AI's internal "mood" vector.
# The 'semantic_domain' provides a constant stream of relevant keywords to ground the AI's focus.
#
# Usage in code:
#   persona = self.semantics.persona_prefix(self.mood.mood_vector)
#   domain_hint = self.semantics.base_domain

semantics:
  name: "e8_base_v3"

    lambda mood: (
        "You are feeling chaotic, fragmented, and electric." if mood.get('entropy', 0.5) > 0.7 and mood.get('intensity', 0.5) > 0.6 else
        "You are feeling exceptionally clear, logical, and focused." if mood.get('coherence', 0.5) > 0.75 else
        "You are feeling calm, quiet, and introspective." if mood.get('intensity', 0.5) < 0.3 else

# --- Core Action Prompts ---
# These are the fundamental prompts used in the main cognitive cycles.
#
# Usage in code:
#   prompt = self.prompts.render("teacher_question", goal=goal_desc, memory_snippet=snippet)
#   prompt = self.prompts.render("explorer_answer", question=q)

prompts:
  teacher_question: |
    {persona}
    Domain Hint: {base_domain}

    High-Level Goal: "{goal}"
    Recent Thoughts (Memory Snippet):
    {memory_snippet}

    Task: Ask one profound, short question (under 20 words) to advance the goal.
    The question MUST include at least one key term from the 'Recent Thoughts' provided.

  explorer_answer: |
    You are the Explorer module. Your task is to provide a structured, speculative answer to the Teacher's question.
    Produce a STRICT first-line JSON object with keys:
    - "claim": A single, declarative sentence summarizing your core hypothesis.
    - "evidence_refs": An array of up to 4 brief strings referencing supporting concepts or theories.
    - "uncertainty": A float from 0.0 (certain) to 1.0 (highly speculative).
    - "actions": An array of 1-2 concrete next steps for investigation.
    - "tags": An array of short, relevant topical keywords.
    Follow the JSON with a blank line, then a concise prose answer (<=4 sentences).

    Question: {question}

  # --- Constitutional AI (Self-Correction & Refinement) ---
  # Used by the critique_and_refine method to improve internal thoughts.
  #
  # Usage in code:
  #   critique_prompt = self.prompts.render("critique_thought", thought=thought, goal=goal_desc)
  #   refine_prompt = self.prompts.render("refine_thought", thought=thought, critique=critique, goal=goal_desc)

  critique_thought: |
    You are an AI's internal critic. Your task is to critique a thought based on its alignment with a primary goal.

    Primary Goal: "{goal}"
    Thought to Critique: "{thought}"

    Critique: In one sentence, analyze if the thought directly or indirectly serves the goal. If it is well-aligned or if a critique is not obvious, respond with only the words "[NO CHANGE]". Otherwise, provide a concise critique.

  refine_thought: |
    You are an AI's internal editor. Your task is to rewrite a thought based on a critique to better align it with a goal.

    Primary Goal: "{goal}"
    Original Thought: "{thought}"
    Critique of Thought: "{critique}"

    New, Refined Thought: Based on the critique, rewrite the thought to be more potent and aligned with the goal. The new thought should be a single, first-person sentence.

  # --- Thought Experiments (Synthetic Memory Generation) ---
  # Used by the DreamEngine to generate hypothetical scenarios.
  #
  # Usage in code:
  #   experiment_prompt = self.prompts.render("thought_experiment", concept=concept_label, details=details, goal=goal_desc)

  thought_experiment: |
    You are an AI running a thought experiment to explore future possibilities.

    Primary Goal: "{goal}"
    Seed Concept: "{concept}"
    Details about Concept: "{details}"

    Narrative: Write a short, first-person narrative (3-4 sentences) from the future where this concept has been successfully applied to achieve the goal. Describe the outcome and the feeling associated with it. This is a hypothetical scenario.
